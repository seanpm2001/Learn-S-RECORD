; Notes
; Motorola S-RECORD does not support comments or strings, but any line that doesn't start with S is ignored by most compilers. For similarity with related languages, each line in this file starts with a semicolon (similar to most assembly languages, although this isn't an assembly language)

; Project language file 1
; For: seanpm2001/Learn-S-RECORD
; About:
; I decided to make Motorola S-RECORD the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-S-RECORD) as Motorola S-RECORD is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Motorola S-RECORD programming language. It only makes sense to Motorola S-RECORD the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
